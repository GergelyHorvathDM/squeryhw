# Attrition prediction

In case of this issue, attrition prediction is formulated as a binary classification type of task. Throughout the task I've followed the standard data science process:
1. Explorative data analysis
2. Data transformation + feature engineering
3. Pattern search
4. Evaluation
*Note: data science process is highly iterative, therefore the insights gained at each step were used to improve the previous steps. Also in this case data gathering and raw data preparation wasn't necessary in a classical sense, because the dataset exhibited relatively good quality (e.g. well-defined features, no missing values)*

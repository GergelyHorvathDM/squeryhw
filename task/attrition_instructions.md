# Employee Attrition - Case Study (Data Scientist)

## Business Problem
Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses and it leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. 

Therefore, businesses, in particular their HR departments have great interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition. The use of classification models to predict if an employee is likely to quit could greatly increase HR’s ability to intervene on time and remedy the situation to prevent attrition.

## Dataset
The main data source is the `employee-attrition.csv` file that contains 1470 HR entries.  Given the limited size of the data set, the model should only be expected to provide modest improvement in identification of attrition vs a random allocation of probability of attrition.

## Instructions

For the purpose of this exercise, you will need to create a git respository in which you should complete the tasks below.

1. Develop a solution to the above business problem that you feel comfortable with presenting to your potential colleagues. You can assume that the colleagues have a data science background and you do not have to explain math and algorithms.

2. Explore/analyse the data to understand it well enough to proceed. Present the findings in a way that it is easy for the audience to understand the data. 

3. Build the machine learning model(s) that you think are the right one to solve the problem. Please be able to explain why you chose a given approach. 

4. Clearly present how you evaluated your approach and show the results. If anything is unclear, please make assumptions and document them. 

### Notes on Instructions

1. Python and its scientific libraries are the preferred toolchain but feel free to use a different toolchain if that allows you to deliver higher quality results. 

2. Imagine that your work is part of a multi-person project and structure your git repository accordingly.

3. As part of your presentation, you will be expected to show the code you have written. You are free to use the code editor of your choice. Presentation of results in a Jupyter notebook is also acceptable. It is, however, recommended that you also write and use code from outside the notebook when developing your solution.

4. You should not spend more than 8 hours on this project. The implementation does not have to be perfect but please be able to explain next steps in optimizing the model, etc. Anything missing from your solution due to time, can be discussed in the presentation.

5. Please prepare any material in English.

6. Please share the link to your git respository with us before the interview. This allows us to review the code further if we do not have time during the interview. If you have any questions about this, do not hesitate to reach out.
